# Useful-Pentesting-Executables
This is where I upload most of the files that are found in my write-ups and not on other well-known github repositories, and also the handmade scripts and exploits that I'm using. These are to be used only in the given scenario of a certain box, other usages are prohibited and I'm not responsible for the actions taken. This being said enjoy!
